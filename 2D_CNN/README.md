# 2D CNN Model
  We constructed a 2D convolutional model for this task. We take the data of shape (<# of samples>, 1, 2500, 12) as the input of the model. The code file 2D_CNN.ipynb contains the preprocessing code for the data we used. If a new set of data is used, please preprocess the input ECG data to this desired shape. Then the data are passed into the first convolutional block with 2 convolutional layers, 2 batch normalization layers and a maxpooling layer. Notice that the kernel size of the first layer is (12, 3), which indicates that we analyze 3 of the 12 leads at a time. After this block, there are 7 nearly identical convolutional blocks with 2 convolutional layers and 2 batch normalization layers. While some slightly difference in size of maxpooling, all blocks are the same and the main construction of the model is shown below. The actual kernel sizes and hyperparameter choices can be found in the code itself in 2D_CNN.ipynb.

  Now this model achieves a validation set accuracy of 0.83 and an AUC of 0.84 on the amyloid pace removed data in the data file. If higher performance of this model is desired, tune the model through the hyperparameter tuning scheme provided in this repository (Section 5).
